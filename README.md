# Free Coin Metrics data archives

These data archives are produced using free Community tier of [Coin Metrics API](https://docs.coinmetrics.io/api/v3/).

Scripts for data generation are in [scripts](scripts) directory.

## Available data

### CSV archives

This data is similar to Coin Metrics [Community Data Downloads](https://coinmetrics.io/data-downloads/).

Files:

* `csv/<coin>.csv` - CSV file per coin with all available free metrics
* [csv/metrics.csv](csv/metrics.csv) - CSV file with metrics descriptions

The archives are updated daily.

## Stability

We will try to keep the layout and file formats of this repository stable, but there is no guarantee. In particular, sets of available assets and metrics can be changed at any time.

## License
